!  2009-Jan-12 (Don Berry) -- Release with fixes to make nucleon-nucleon inter-
!         actions work, and to make MPI version work.

   2009-May-04 (DKB) In main program, moved incrementing of istep from before calls to
      subtract_vcom, tnorm and newton to after. One effect is istep now counts how
      many steps have been completed, rather than counting the step currently being
      calculated. However, the main reason for this change is so tnorm can be done at
      the same point as in old versions of the code. In older versions, tnorm was done
      at the beginning of a measurement group (at the beginning of the "do ngroup"
      loop). In version 6.0.6, however, tnorm would be done at the end of a group
      if tnormalize=ntot*nind. This alters measurement statistics in a way one 
      probably does not want.
