Here are issues to be addressed:

A. Pressure tensor calculation

B. Uniform magnetic field along the z-direction

C. Oscillating electric field, for linear response.

D. 1) Replace nested DO loops over ngroup, ntot and nind, with a single
      DO loop over timesteps. The statistical calculations of potential
      energy and pressure that have been done at the end of every loop
      over nind microsteps, and at the end of every ntot sets of micro
      steps, will now be controlled by modulo calculations.
   2) Should warmup steps be done the same way?

E. Decide what to do about calculating g(r) and S(q). Do we keep those
   calculations in the MD code itself? or relegate them to post proces-
   sing?

F. Do true checkpointing, so one can actually restart a job from where
   it crashed or was halted.

G. Update the random number functions to F95 syntax. Do away with
   common blocks.

H. 1) Remember to update version date in all source files.
   2) Take Chuck's name off the author list (so he won't be blamed for my
      mistakes).
